# Guess the Number 🎲

A simple Python console game. The program picks a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it.

## Features
- Randomly generated secret number
- Input validation (rejects non-numeric entries)
- Feedback until the correct guess: “Too low” / “Too high”

## How to Run
```bash
python guess_the_number.py

# What I Learned
- Handling user input safely
- Using loops and conditionals to control program flow
- Basic error handling with try/except
