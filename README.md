# CV Python Projects

A small portfolio of my first Python projects (Guess the Number, Calculator).  
These projects demonstrate beginner-level programming concepts, problem solving, and logic.

## Projects

1. **Guess the Number** — a console game where the player guesses a secret number.  
   - Code: [`guess-the-number/guess_the_number.py`](guess-the-number/guess_the_number.py)  
   - README: [`guess-the-number/README.md`](guess-the-number/README.md)

2. **Simple Calculator** — a basic four-operation calculator with input validation.  
   - Code: [`calculator/calculator.py`](calculator/calculator/calculator.py)  
   - README: [`calculator/README.md`](calculator/README.md)
